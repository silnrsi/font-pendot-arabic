This file provides detailed information on the Pendot A Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Pendot A fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Pendot A is a prototype font for writing education in the Arabic script. It is incomplete and will change considerably. Please do not use this as a source of derivatives. A much more useful font will eventually be released that will be a better source. Thank you!
